1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
- In server-side routing, when a user clicks on a link, a server picks up the request from the user and finds the page requested, then serves it. In client-side routing, when a user accesses a site, all of the data is obtained from the server up front, and when a user clicks on a link, the logic of the application will serve the page to the user with no additional server interaction for the routing.
